leave_interpol_desc;Interpol has an annual budget of around €78 million, most of which is provided through annual contributions by its membership of 190 countries (as of 2015). To keep Interpol as politically neutral as possible, its charter forbids it, at least in theory, from undertaking interventions or activities of a political, military, religious, or racial nature or involving itself in disputes over such matters. Its work focuses primarily on public safety and battling terrorism, crimes against humanity, environmental crime, genocide, war crimes, organised crime, piracy, illicit traffic in works of art, illicit drug production, drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, human trafficking, money laundering, child pornography, white-collar crime, computer crime, intellectual property crime, and corruption.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1511100;The 1963 Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed On Board Aircraft authorised the aircraft commander to impose reasonable measures, including restraint, on any person he or she had reason to believe has committed or was about to commit such an act, where necessary to protect the safety of the aircraft.

EVTDESC1511101;The Hague Hijacking Convention (formally the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft) is a multilateral treaty by which states agree to prohibit and punish aircraft hijacking. The convention does not apply to customs, law enforcement or military aircraft, thus it applies exclusively to civilian aircraft. The convention only addresses situations in which an aircraft takes off or lands in a place different from its country of registration. The convention sets out the principle of aut dedere aut judicare—that a party to the treaty must prosecute an aircraft hijacker if no other state requests his or her extradition for prosecution of the same crime.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1511102;The Convention criminalises the following behaviour: Committing an act of violence against a person on board an aircraft in flight if it is likely to endanger the safety of the aircraft, destroying an aircraft being serviced or damaging such an aircraft in such a way that renders it incapable of flight or which is likely to endanger its safety in flight, placing or causing to be placed on an aircraft a device or substance which is likely to destroy or cause damage to an aircraft, destroying or damaging air navigation facilities or interfering with their operation if it is likely to endanger the safety of aircraft, communicating information which is known to be false, thereby endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight, attempting any of 1–5, and being an accomplice to any of 1–6.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC1511106;A state that ratifies the Convention agrees to prohibit the manufacture, storage, transport, or entry of unmarked plastic explosives in its territory.

The Convention also establishes an International Explosives Technical Commission, which is composed of experts in the field explosives manufacturing and detection. The Commission can propose amendments to the Technical Annex of the treaty.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1511107;The Terrorist Bombings Convention (formally the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) is a 1997 United Nations treaty designed to criminalise terrorist bombings.

The convention also seeks to promote police and judicial co-operation to prevent, investigate and punish those acts. As of September 2016, the convention has been ratified by 169 states.;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1511108;Article 2.1 defines the crime of terrorist financing as the offense committed by "any person" who "by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and willfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out" an act "intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organisation to do or to abstain from doing any act." State parties to this treaty also commit themselves to the freezing and seizure of funds intended to be used for terrorist activities and to share the forfeited funds with all state parties.
